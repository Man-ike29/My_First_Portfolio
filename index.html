    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm excited to share my first portfolio website with you. This is the beginning of my journey in web development, and I'm passionate about creating engaging and functional web experiences. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my growing skills and dedication to learning new technologies.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that every great developer starts with a single line of code, and this website represents my commitment to continuous learning and improvement. As I progress in my development journey, I plan to add more projects, skills, and experiences to this portfolio.</p>
    
    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>My primary goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer who can create meaningful solutions to real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in modern web technologies and how they can be used to create user-friendly applications that make a positive impact.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with other developers, and contribute to open-source projects. This portfolio will serve as a living document of my progress and achievements as I continue to grow in the field of software development.</p>
